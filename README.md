## ⌨️ TypingMind Plugin

The TypingMind plugin is a powerful tool that enhances the capabilities of GPT. With the TypingMind plugin, GPT can seamlessly make calls to any API without being restricted by CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies. This allows GPT to access external data sources and services, opening up a wide range of possibilities for integration and interaction.

To use the TypingMind plugin, simply install go to the [TypingMind Plugin page](https://cloud.typingmind.com/plugins/p-01HKBS6JY387AW48VJQ3JR50A2) and click on Import.

## 🐳 Docker

You can use the Docker image to quickly run the proxy server. Here's how:

1. Pull the Docker image:

```shell
docker pull obeoneorg/simple-cors-proxy
```

2. Run the Docker container:

```shell
docker run -d --name simple-cors-proxy  -p 8080:8080 obeoneorg/simple-cors-proxy
```

## 🐳 Docker Compose

You can use the Docker Compose file to quickly run the proxy server. Here's how:

1. Run the Docker Compose file:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```


## 💻 Usage

To use this proxy server without Docker, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/obeone/simple-cors-proxy.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

3. Start the server:

```shell
npm start
```

4. The server will be running on port 8080 by default. You can change the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

### Advanced Usage

If you need to remove some headers (for example `X-Forwarded-For`), you can use the `x-headers-delete` header. For example, if you want to remove the `X-Forwarded-For` header, you can set the `x-headers-delete` header to `X-Forwarded-For`.

You can also use the environment variable `HEADERS_TO_DELETE` to remove specific headers, or both.

In both cases, if you need to remove multiple headers, you can use a comma-separated list.

So for example :

```shell
docker run -d --name simple-cors-proxy  -p 8080:8080 -e HEADERS_TO_DELETE=X-Forwarded-For,X-Forwarded-Host obeoneorg/simple-cors-proxy
```
